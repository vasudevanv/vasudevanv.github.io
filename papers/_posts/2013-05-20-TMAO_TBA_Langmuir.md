   TMAO, a potent osmolyte, and TBA, a denaturant, have similar molecular architecture but somewhat different chemistry. We employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations to quantify their behavior at vapor–water and octane–water interfaces. We show that interfacial structure—density and orientation—and their dependence on solution concentration are markedly different for the two molecules. TMAO molecules are moderately surface active and adopt orientations with their N–O vector approximately parallel to the aqueous interface. That is, not all methyl groups of TMAO at the interface point away from the water phase. In contrast, TBA molecules act as molecular amphiphiles, are highly surface active, and, at low concentrations, adopt orientations with their methyl groups pointing away and the C–O vector pointing directly into water. The behavior of TMAO at aqueous interfaces is only weakly dependent on its solution concentration, whereas that of TBA depends strongly on concentration. We show that this concentration dependence arises from their different hydrogen bonding capabilities—TMAO can only accept hydrogen bonds from water, whereas TBA can accept (donate) hydrogen bonds from (to) water or other TBA molecules. The ability to self-associate, particularly visible in TBA molecules in the interfacial layer, allows them to sample a broad range of orientations at higher concentrations. In light of the role of TMAO and TBA in biomolecular stability, our results provide a reference with which to compare their behavior near biological interfaces. Also, given the ubiquity of aqueous interfaces in biology, chemistry, and technology, our results may be useful in the design of interfacially active small molecules with the aim to control their orientations and interactions.
